# Project Title: The-Studier
** Description: ** A Gamified Study Program Built in Python for HackPrinceton Fall 2025

---

## Inspiration: 
The Inspiration for The-Studier Program was from The MacMillan Fellowship Project at Rider University that I am currently a participant of, with the topic being Enhancing University Exam Performance Through Programming-Based Study Tools.

---

## What it Does: 
This Program is a universal study assistance tool that helps students prepare for their upcoming exams. The problem that this program solves is keeping the brain stimulated while preparing for upcoming academics. 

---

## How I Built It:
 I built this program fully in Python, due to its simplicity, and variety of hardware it can run on. 

---

## API/Datasets Used:
 This project does not use an APIs or datasets, due to everything in the code being self-contained using built in Python libraries. This means no web services, databases or external data files are necessary, making this program able to run entirely locally on the user's computer.

---

## Challenges Ran Into: 
The first challenge that was ran into was keeping everything clean and bug-free due to multiple game modes within this one program. The next challenge was handling user input due to the fact if the user inputs a command that was not expected, the system would crash. Another challenge ran into was getting the Jeopardy music to run on different operating systems without the need of any external files. On another game, the bingo logic used for the most efficient way of playing took careful debugging. Finally, the balancing of simplicity, interactivity and practicality, to continue to keep the program fun and lightweight so the terminal can run the program easily. 

---

## Accomplishments: 
I am proud of the creation of this project because of the fact it aligns with my goals of the MacMillan Fellowship I am currently participating in. 

---

## What's Next: 
In the future I am hoping to allow for a cleaner interface, possible one where you can use the mouse instead of complete use of the program being fully with the keyboard. 

---

## Instructions to Run and Test Code: 
First Download the Stuider copy.py and run it in the latest version of Python IDLE. This program must be downloaded and run locally because it does not run directly on GitHub or in a web-browser.

---

## Dependencies/Installation Commands:
 This project is built within Python 3's standard libraries requiring no external dependencies.
